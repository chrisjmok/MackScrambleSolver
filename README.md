# MackScrambleSolver
Foreword:
I recommend trying to write this program yoursefl if you are in this
class. It is a good learning opportunity.  I will post the design in a
separate file so you can write it in whatever language you want.  

A program written in Python and bash to analyze sample tests for the
most likely questions that would appear on the final.  If they are not
exactly matching it will still show that they are similar by matching
words.
